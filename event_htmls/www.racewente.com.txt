It is a full 3-day weekend expedition for your friends and family in one of the most magical places on earth: Wente Scout Reservation.This team and solo mountain bike race fills very fast because it is limited to just 550 competitors. In reality, the scale of the event is larger than this because racers come with friends and family. It's what makes this experience so special.Wente Scout Reservation plays host to thousands of scouts each year and introduces a large portion of them to the joy of mountain biking. The Wente 8-Hour MTB Relay Race does a lot to contribute to the further development of this program, and in its way, the future mountain bikers of America. Whether you've been a part of Wente's regular programming, or have never been exposed to the world of scouting, you're in for a great treat during this weekend.‍ScheduleOur Schedule of EventsFRIDAY11:00 AMYou may begin to arrive at Wente3:00 PMPacket pickup opens5:30 PMDinner service begins (ticket required)7:00 PMPacket Pickup Closes | Dinner service ends.8:00 PMIce cream social ($5pp)10:00 PMQuiet time.SATURDAY6:30 AMPacket pickup opens | Breakfast service begins8:00 AMRace Start!9:00 AMBreakfast service ends.11:30 AMLunch service begins1:30 PMLunch service ends5:00 PMRace ends!5:30 PMAwards ceremony5:30 PMDinner service begins7:00 PMDinner service ends8:00 PMIce cream social ($5pp)SUNDAY7:30 AMBreakfast service begins9:00 AMPost race course repair work.
