The rides starts and ends at Kendall-Jackson Winery.

What Times Do the Routes Start (and what is the general schedule)?
Below is the schedule for 2024. The schedule for 2025 is subject to change. Be sure to check your email for updates before the event!

**At 10:30 AM at mile 39.5 of the Long Route, we will be implementing a mandatory time cut. If you do not reach this turn onto Sweetwater Springs Road before 10:30 AM, you will be directed to continue on the Medium Route. More details about this time cut are below.

Why Is There a Mandatory Time Cut-off for the Long Route?
At 10:30am at mile 39.5 of the Long Route we will be implementing a mandatory time cut. This may impact your ability to climb Sweetwater Springs Road, preventing you from completing segment #3.
In order to make this time cut and complete the entire Long Route, you will need to maintain an average speed of at least 13.5 MPH to this point. If you do not reach this turn onto Sweetwater Springs Road at mile 39.5 before 10:30 AM, you will be directed to continue on the Medium Route, and will have to follow the orange arrows back to the finish.
We will automatically modify your scoring detail to place you in the Medium Route so that you may still be officially scored on the first two segments.
This time cut is necessary to ensure that you have returned to the post-ride celebration at a reasonable hour before it ends, and that you aren't still on the course after we have to relieve volunteers from their aid station and support duties.
