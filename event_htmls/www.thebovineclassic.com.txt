Ready For More CowbellThe Seriously Unserious Gravel Ride Is Back!"America's 4th-Hardest Cow-Themed Gravel Ride ... in a California Wine Region ... Not Called Napa or Sonoma" stampedes back October 25, 2025Welcome to the gravel event where serious cyclists come to unserious, where world-class wine country meets wild gravel adventures, and where our Lanterne Moouge finisher becomes the day's biggest legend.Sure, we've got timed segments for the competitively inclined. Yeah, there are awards across all four routes. And well, Bicycling Magazine named it a top-10 must-ride gravel event for 2025. But what really sets us apart? We're the event that feels like coming home to your herd – if your herd happened to love gravel and really bad cow puns.Join our 4th year of proving that the best rides aren't about being first – they're about being part of something MOOvelous.3 Routes, Limited SpotsRoam Your Perfect Pasture.From first-time grazers to seasoned stampeders, we've got your gravel dreams covered. Three routes, fully supported with aid stations that'll make you want to mooove in permanently:The Big Bovine: For those who think "epic" sounds like a nice warm-upThe Feisty: When you want long, but not epic longThe Happy Bovine: Proof that size doesn't matter (but fun does)Gear tip: This is mixed-surface magic, folks. Think 38c-42c tires to handle everything from dusty washboard to buttery tarmac. Route details are still cooking, but one thing's for sure – there'll be dirt, there'll be climbing, and there'll be grins wider than a cow's tail.Bonus ContentRiding with us Thursday or Friday? You must RSVP!‍Sign up for FREE bonus content here!Event SCHEDULEThursdayStay tuned.
