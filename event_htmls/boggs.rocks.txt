20 Years!The 2025 Edition of the Boggs 8 Hour Race marks Bike Monkey's 20th anniversary!This year's event will be special. In 2006, Bike Monkey produced its first ever bike race in this forest.

Learn more in our race guide.Gerard's Paella is back!Gerard's Paella awaits you at the finish line.8+ hour MTB RACEYou can race 9 hours of this 8 hour race.Boggs 8-Hour is a mountain bike relay race that takes place annually in Boggs Demonstration State Forest near the small mountain town of Cobb, California.The race started in 2006, and has steadily grown. It is one of the very few endurance relay mountain bike races alive and well today. You can race 8+ hours by yourself, or join in as a relay team of 2 or 3 people.We encourage camping, and that you make an entire weekend out of it. It usually rains or snows on us in some capacity, even in May for some inexplicable reason. Somehow, this makes it special, memorable, and reminiscent of that very first year when flurries marked the start of our race.Boggs is Bike Monkey's origin story.Exclusive Camping OpportunityCamp with us!Since the Valley Fire in 2015, and subsequent restoration of Boggs Demonstration State Forest, overnight camping within the forest has been suspended.Boggs 8 Hour is granted an exception that allows overnight camping. However, you must reserve one of only 200 tent spaces that are available.When you register for the Boggs 8 Hour race, you have the option of including a Small or Large Vehicle site with your entry. This is required if you intend to camp at Boggs on race weekend.Where is this?Boggs Mountain, Cobb, California.Boggs Mountain State Demonstration Forest is a 3,500 acre state property that is owned and managed by CalFire. Its unique geographic characteristic exposes it to a unique weather pattern in California, and thus receives upwards of 70 inches of rain per year, and often snow as late as early May.We've experienced this multiple times throughout our history, but sometimes we get a break, and the sun comes out.Directions (Boggs Mountain)3.0 Hours north of San Jose.2.5 Hours north of San Francisco.2.1 Hours west of Sacramento.1.2 Hours north of Santa Rosa.THE 8-Hour COURSE9.9 Miles, 1157'The 2025 race course is longer without any additional climbing.LONGER: We added 2.1 Miles and maintained the same amount of elevation gain by getting rid of the climb up Road 200.MID RACE STATUS CHECK: At almost exactly the half-way mark on every lap, competitors swing back through the start/finish village!FIGURE 8: This year's course features a figure-8 loop where race traffic crosses paths (safely).Our 20th year anniversary course features some great changes, and additions that will double the fun.THE HILL CLIMB COURSE4 Miles, 1089'The new hill climb is longer, and more fun!It's not 100% up either.The course begins at the bottom of Road 100 and ascends to the beginning of the all-too-familiar climb up Road 200 which features pitches of nearly 16%. But then it mellows out, and rolls with a solid mile of recovery and moderate descent.The final climb up the top part of Mac's and Karen's Trail will be your nail in the coffin.‍ScheduleFriday1:00PM - You may arrive!2:00PM - Packet Pickup Opens4:00PM - Better get your ass to the Hill Climb start, or make your way to the course to make some noise!5:00PM - Hill Climb Start6:00PM - Hill Climb Awards8:00PM - Packet Pickup Closes8:00PM - Rider MeetingSaturday6:00AM - Packet Pickup Opens7:30AM - Get staged8:00AM - 8 Hour Start4:00PM - No more lap starts5:00PM - 8 Hour Finish5:30PM - 8 Hour Awards6:00PM - Closing Remarks7:00PM - Super-DeleriousSundayThere is no programmed activity on Sunday.Campers must depart Boggs before the end of the day on Sunday.
