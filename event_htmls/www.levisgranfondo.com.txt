This event changed my life. Last year I was 300 pounds got disgusted and then bought a Roubaix SL4, signed up for the Piccolo and started training, When last years day was arriving I started having panic attacks as I am also a veteran with PTSD and decided to back out. At the last minute I got in my car, drove from Tahoe to Santa Rosa checked in and everyone was kind and supportive. Since then, I lost 100 pounds and rode the Medio. It was an incredible experience, making it to the coast and chewing up the road with fantastic vistas. Once again, thanks Levi and the rest of the crew, most importantly the volunteers who get this event going.Patrick Rulo, ParticipantI have done quite some gran fondos in my life, all of them in Europe, including classics like the Nove Colli, the Marmotte, Amstel Gold Race etc. Levi's GranFondo is by far the best organised event with a great route and amazing finish street. This is a must-do for every cyclist!Ward Grootjans, ParticipantWith many European and American gran fondos and sportifs, this one is by far the best so far in the US. Great route, support, views and vibe.Stephen Marquette, ParticipantIt was an amazing experience. All the riders and the other supporting people (police, helpers, people at the roadside) brought a great atmosphere which I felt all along the ride. Excellent organization made me feel safe and well supported in any moment. Thanks and see you next year!Gernart Brandl, ParticipantI'm amazed at the community of this event. Firefighters, Ambulances, Sheriff's, CHPs, and all the volunteers. It takes a village. This event is the best example of this idea I've ever seen. Period.Richard Colorado, ParticipantSimply awesome day on the bike. The Panzer course has Alpine style climbing and descents, beautiful redwood forests, spectacular ocean views, and just a few hills. Plus the best organized and marshaled ride I have been on. Outstanding 2016!

It's a great match for beginner road cyclists. It does not feature a formal aid station, however, you may stop at Veteran's Memorial Beach in Healdsburg to top off water and take a break.There are no aid stations on the Piccolino route.PiccoloThe Piccolo route is a relatively easy 40-mile jaunt through picturesque wine country next to vineyards and gently rolling hills. It splits the difference between a beginner ride and the Medio. It's easy, but it's 40 miles of easy.1 AID STATION- 29mi: Rued WineryMedioThe Medio route is the quintessential Sonoma County weekend ride. It features two aid stations evenly spaced for you to top off, amazing, fast-rolling tarmac with a mix of vineyards and two notable climbs.2 AID STATIONS- 31mi: Cloverdale- 47mi: Alexander ValleyGeysersThe Geysers route is a completely new flavor of Sonoma County and brings you up some serious climbs to accumulate over 6,000' of elevation in 81 miles. You will ride through a region that is home to North America's largest producer of clean, reliable renewable geothermal power, and experience sweeping views of Sonoma County's wine region.3 AID STATIONS- 31mi: Cloverdale- 52mi: Geysers- 66mi: Alexander ValleyGRAN Our Gran route continues to include road the event was named for: King Ridge. Participants make their way through Cazadero before traveling along one of California's most celebrated roads in cycling. This is a very difficult route, and while it's not quite the epic that the Growler is, you'll be challenged by two very substantial climbs.3 AID STATIONS + 2 WATER STOPS- 29mi: Cazadero (water)- 45mi: King Ridge- 67mi: Skaggs (water)- 89mi: Cloverdale‍- 1mi: Alexander ValleyThe Growler The Growler is a behemoth with a signature level of difficulty that rivals some of the most difficult professional road race courses in the world. After tackling King Ridge, you then take on a completely new set of roads that travel like the spine of a dragon's backbone high above the surrounding hills of Sonoma County. Your return to the gently rolling valley floor comes at the price of taking on two more long, steep climbs along Stewarts Point Road. It's not nearly over. The Geysers, and another 3,000' of difficult climbing awaits long after you've already amassed nearly ten thousand feet of elevation over the course of the previous 90 miles.4 AID STATIONS + 2 WATER STOPS- 29mi: Cazadero (water)- 45mi: King Ridge- 67mi: Skaggs (water)- 89mi: Cloverdale- 109mi: Geysers- 123mi: Alexander ValleyGet on our list!Fill out this form to be placed on our mailing list!‍Sign Up for EmailOfficial PartnersYou might also want to try:
